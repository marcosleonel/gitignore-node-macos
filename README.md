# .gitignore for Node.js + MacOS

*A `.gitignore` template for commonly ignored files in Node.js development in MacOS.*

Instead of repeating myself in every project start, I united the files which most frequently appears and should be ignored in the commits.

You can find more for other technologies in the [Github's repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore) dedicated to `.gitignore` files.
